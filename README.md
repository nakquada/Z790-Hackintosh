What Works
---

* Everything works except Wifi (I never bother with it, but it's my understanding that it should work just fine if you want to get it going)
* Onboard audio also should work fine but I never used it at all.


I use 3 displays and this has been my daily driver (replacing my M1 Mac Mini) for a few months now. Never once crashed on me or had a blip in any way. Rock solid.
